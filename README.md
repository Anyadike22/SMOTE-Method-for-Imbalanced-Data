**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** is a popular method used to address class imbalance in datasets. It works by generating synthetic samples for the minority class, rather than simply duplicating existing samples. SMOTE creates these new instances by interpolating between existing minority class data points, which helps increase the representation of the minority class and reduces bias toward the majority class.

Key features of SMOTE include:
1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: SMOTE generates new data points along the line segments joining neighboring minority class samples, adding diversity to the dataset.
2. **Improved Model Performance**: By balancing the dataset, SMOTE enhances the model's ability to learn patterns from the minority class, improving recall and overall performance on imbalanced data.
3. **Reduces Overfitting**: Unlike simple oversampling, SMOTE minimizes the risk of overfitting caused by duplicate samples.

However, SMOTE may amplify noise if the minority class contains outliers, and it can struggle in high-dimensional spaces. Despite these limitations, SMOTE is widely used in applications like fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and churn prediction, where class imbalance is common.
